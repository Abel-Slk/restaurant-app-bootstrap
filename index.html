            NOTE: pretty much all of "col col-sm col-md" means "tuse the cols remaining after the div above is placed" - it's just that for extra small sizes all 12 are already taken, so the 2nd div gets stack below. But the general idea is that when we don't specify the NUMBER we're letting it take the REMAINING space. (I wonder though wouldn't just "col" be enough? Mb it would, but perhaps col-sm and col-md are added just for consistency - to directly correspond to classes in the first div. And this way we can later easily change any such pair of classes if we'll want to!) -->
